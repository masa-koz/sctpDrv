Environment:
Windows Operating System on which you can execute WDK

How to get the latest code:
Please access to the below repositry.
	http://svn.sctp.jp/sctpDrv/

How to build:
Before you build sctpDrv, you have to download WDK (Windows Driver Kit)
via Microsoft Connect (http://connect.microsoft.com/) and install it.
If you want to build the installer package too,
the WiX (Windows Installer XML) toolset is needed.
Please get the WiX 2.0 from http://wix.sourceforge.net/, extreact it, and
insert the paths for WiX tools into PATH environment variable.

To build the installer package, you will launch the build environments of WDK
for Windows XP and Windows Vista.
	"Launch Windows XP x86 Free Build Environment"
	"Launch Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 x86 Free Build Environment"
At first, enter the following command into Windows XP build environment.
("C:\work\sctpDrv" is the path of sctpDrv's top directory on my machine.)
	C:\work\sctpDrv>build
After that, enter the following command into Windows Vista build environment.
	C:\work\sctpDrv>build

Finally, move to wix/ directory on Windows Vista build environment and
execute the following command in order to create the installer package.
	C:\work\sctpDrv\wix>nmake -f Makefile.wix
